A Retrieval-Augmented Generation app that makes document work fast and precise. Use chunking, info extraction, LLM inference, and prompt engineering to turn files into searchable knowledge. The app runs in Python and ships a Streamlit UI for fast testing.

Features
- Chunk documents into semantic pieces for accurate retrieval.
- Extract structured data (tables, key-value pairs, entities).
- Query with natural language and get precise answers.
- Summarize long documents to short notes.
- Prompt templates for task-specific LLM calls.
- Streamlit front end for quick demos.
- Simple Python API for integration.

Architecture (high level)
- Ingest: PDF, DOCX, TXT, HTML.
- Parser: convert files to clean text and metadata.
- Chunker: split text by semantic boundaries.
- Embeddings: convert chunks to vectors.
- Vector store: FAISS / Milvus / SQLite-based store.
- Retriever: fast nearest neighbor search.
- Reranker (optional): filter and sort candidate chunks.
- LLM inference: generate answers, summaries, and extraction outputs.
- UI: Streamlit app for search and chat.

Quick start
- Clone the repo.
- Create a Python venv.
- Install requirements.
- Start the demo app.

Releases and download
- Visit the releases page to get packaged builds and installers:
  https://github.com/Dieg-oh/DocuMind_RAG_Project/releases
- The releases page contains assets. Download the release file and execute it. Example:
  - Download documind_release_v1.0.tar.gz from the Releases page.
  - Extract, then run the included install.sh or run setup.py:
    - tar -xzf documind_release_v1.0.tar.gz
    - cd documind_release_v1.0
    - ./install.sh
- The badge above links to the same Releases page for quick access:

Install (developer mode)
1. python3 -m venv .venv
2. source .venv/bin/activate
3. pip install -r requirements.txt
4. export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
5. python -m documind.setup_db

Run the Streamlit demo
- streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py
- Open http://localhost:8501 and load a document.

CLI usage
- Ingest a document
  - documind ingest --file ./docs/whitepaper.pdf --id wp-2025
- Query
  - documind query --id wp-2025 --q "What is the main risk model used?"
- Summarize
  - documind summarize --id wp-2025 --length short

API snippet (Python)
- Simple example to query via API client:
```python
from documind.client import DocuMindClient

client = DocuMindClient(api_key="sk-...")
client.ingest_file("reports/annual.pdf", doc_id="annual-2024")
resp = client.query("What are the growth drivers?", top_k=5)
print(resp.answer)
```

Design notes

Chunking strategy
- Use sentence and semantic boundaries.
- Keep chunk size between 200 and 700 tokens.
- Add overlap of 20-30% to preserve context at chunk edges.
- Tag chunks with source, page, and section metadata.

Vector store & retrieval
- Default: FAISS for local demos.
- Option: Milvus or Pinecone for scale.
- Normalize vectors and use cosine similarity for ranking.
- Store original text and metadata for final LLM prompt context.

Prompt patterns
- Use short system prompts for control.
- Supply retrieved chunks as context. Keep context token budget in mind.
- Use few-shot examples for structured extraction tasks.
- Use instruction templates for summarization and Q&A.

Summarizer
- Two modes: extractive and abstractive.
- For large docs, run multi-stage summarization:
  - Summarize chunks in parallel.
  - Summarize the summaries.
- Keep summary length controllable by a parameter.

Q&A flow
1. Receive query.
2. Retrieve top-k chunks.
3. Re-rank for freshness and relevance.
4. Build prompt with instruction, query, and context.
5. Call LLM for final answer.
6. Return answer with source citations.

Model & performance tips
- For prototypes, use OpenAI or local LLMs (Llama, Mistral).
- Use batching for embeddings to save time.
- Cache embeddings for unchanged documents.
- Monitor token usage when using cloud LLMs.
- Use light rerankers to avoid extra token cost.

File formats supported
- PDF (text and OCR)
- DOCX
- TXT
- HTML
- CSV (tabular extraction)
- Images (OCR pipeline available)

Security & privacy
- Keep API keys out of code.
- Use environment variables for secrets.
- Optionally run inference on-premise for sensitive docs.

Testing
- Run unit tests:
  - pytest tests/
- Use sample data in tests/samples for end-to-end checks.

Configuration
- config.yml controls:
  - chunk_size
  - overlap
  - vector_backend
  - model endpoints
  - search parameters

Example config (snippet)
```yaml
chunk_size: 500
overlap: 100
vector_backend:
  engine: faiss
model:
  name: gpt-4o-mini
  max_tokens: 512
```

Scalability
- For heavy loads:
  - Move embeddings to a managed store.
  - Shard FAISS indexes.
  - Use async workers for ingestion.
  - Use a separate worker pool for LLM calls.

Logging & observability
- Use structured logs (JSON).
- Export metrics: ingested_docs, queries_per_minute, avg_latency.
- Add tracing for LLM calls to monitor token usage.

Streamlit UX tips
- Show live retrieval results before final LLM call.
- Allow users to toggle context chunks.
- Show source page and text highlights.

Contributing
- Fork the repo.
- Create a feature branch.
- Add tests and docs for changes.
- Open a pull request with a clear description.

Code of conduct
